## 🧑‍💻 *~ About Me ~*

**Yo, Joseph here!** 👋

A Web Developer fresh from a bootcamp. I've been coding my whole life; turns out there's more to GitHub than a place for downloading Minecraft mods... 😅

I'm super eager to learn about everything that is out there in the field! 📖

### 👀 *Interests*

- 🎮 *Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis*, Rhythm Games and satisfying parries.
- 📝 Modern Productivity Tools (Obsidian user here!)

#### My Cat (sleepy)...
